# ðŸ“Ÿ  Automated Toll Gate Using Arduino (Vehicle Detection Gate)
Automated Toll Gate Using Arduino is a smart system designed to control toll gates without human 
intervention. It uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect vehicles and a servo motor to automatically open 
and close the gate, enhancing traffic flow and reducing manual effort.

### ðŸ”§ Hardware Setup

Working Principle
### ðŸ”§ Working Principle

1. The **Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)** continuously monitors the distance in front of the toll gate using sound waves. It sends pulses via the `trigPin` and listens for their echo through the `echoPin` to detect incoming vehicles.

2. **When a vehicle is detected within 20 cm**:
   - The **servo motor rotates to 0Â°**, simulating the gate opening.
   - The **green LED** turns on to indicate that the gate is open.
   - The **vehicle counter** increments to track the passing vehicle.

3. **When no vehicle is detected**:
   - The **servo motor returns to 90Â°**, simulating the gate closing.
   - The **red LED** turns on to indicate that the gate is closed.
   - The **green LED** turns off, and the system resets to detect the next vehicle.

4. This process repeats continuously, enabling **automatic, real-time gate operation** based on vehicle detection.
